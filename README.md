# Mockaton 
_Mockaton_ is a mock server for developing and testing frontends.

It scans `Config.mocksDir` for files following a specific directory
and file name convention, which is similar to the URL paths. For
example, the following file will be served for `/api/user/1234`
```
my-mocks-dir/api/user/[user-id].GET.200.json
```

By the way, [this browser
extension](https://github.com/ericfortis/devtools-ext-tar-http-requests) can
be used for downloading a TAR of your XHR requests following that convention.


### Mock Variants
Each route can have many mocks, which could either be:
- Different response status code. For example, for testing error responses.
- Comment on the filename, which is anything within parentheses.

Those alternatives can be manually selected in the dashboard
UI, or programmatically, for instance, for setting up tests.

About the default mock file, the first file in **alphabetical order** wins.

### Proxying Routes
`Config.proxyFallback` lets you specify a target
server for serving routes you donâ€™t have mocks for.


## Getting Started
The best way to learn _Mockaton_ is by checking out this repo and
exploring its [sample-mocks/](./sample-mocks) directory. Then, run
[`./_usage_example.js`](./_usage_example.js) and youâ€™ll see this dashboard:

![](./README-dashboard.png)


### Mock Variants of Status Code
The **sample-mocks/** directory has three mock alternatives for serving
`/api/user/friends`:
- _200 - OK_
- _204 - No Content_ with an empty list of friends
- _500 - Internal Server Error_
	- BTW, 500 mocks get autogenerated for routes that have no 500â€™s.

### Mock Variants with Comments
Comments are anything within parentheses, including them.

## Delay ðŸ•“
The clock icon next to the mock selector is a checkbox for delaying a
particular response. They are handy for testing spinners.

The milliseconds for the delay is globally configurable via `Config.delay = 1200`

---

## Basic Usage (see [_usage_example.js](./_usage_example.js))
```
npm install mockaton
```
Create a `my-mockaton.js` file
```js
import { resolve } from 'node:path'
import { Mockaton } from 'src/Mockaton'

Mockaton({ // Config options
  port: 2345,
  mocksDir: resolve('my-mocks-dir')
})
```

```sh
node my-mockaton.js
```

## Config Options
```ts
interface Config {
  mocksDir: string
  staticDir?: string 
  host?: string, // 'localhost'
  port?: number // 0 auto-assigned
  delay?: number // 1200 ms
  cookies?: object 
  database?: object // for "Transforms"
  skipOpen?: boolean // Prevents opening the dashboard in a browser
  proxyFallback?: string // e.g. http://localhost:9999 Target for relaying routes without mocks
  allowedExt?: RegExp // /\.(json|txt|md|mjs)$/ Just for excluding temporary editor files (e.g. JetBrains appends a ~)
}
```

## Cookies
```js
import { jwtCookie } from 'src/Mockaton'

Config.cookies = {
  'My Admin User': 'my-cookie=1;Path=/;SameSite=strict',
  'My Normal User': 'my-cookie=0;Path=/;SameSite=strict',
  'My JWT': jwtCookie('my-cookie', {
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    picture: 'https://cdn.auth0.com/avatars/jd.png'
  })
}
```
The key is just a label used in dashboard for selecting the desired cookie.

That `jwtCookie` has a hardcoded header and signature. In other
words, itâ€™s useful iff you care about its payload in the frontend.

## File Name Convention


### Extension
`.Method.HttpResponseStatusCode.FileExt`

The **file extension** can anything, but `.md` and `.mjs` are reserved
for documentation, and mock processors (more on that later).

The `Config.allowedExt` regex defaults to: `/\.(json|txt|md|mjs)$/`


### Dynamic Parameters
Anything within square brackets. For example, 
<pre>
api/user/<b>[id]</b>/<b>[age]</b>.GET.200.json
</pre>

### Comments
Comments are anything within parentheses, including them.
They are ignored for URL purposes, so they have no effect
on the URL mask. For example, these two are for `/api/foo`
<pre>
api/foo<b>(my comment)</b>.GET.200.json<b>(foo)</b>
api/foo.GET.200.json
</pre>

### Query String Params
<pre>
api/video<b>?limit=[limit]</b>.GET.200.json
</pre>

The query string is ignored when routing to it. Itâ€™s
only used for documenting the URL API contract.

BTW, in Windows, filenames containing "?" are [not
permitted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file),
but since thatâ€™s part of the query string, itâ€™s ignored anyway.



### Default (index-like) file
For the default route of a directory, omit the name (just use
the extension). For example, the following files will be routed
to `api/foo` because comments and the query string are ignored.
```text
api/foo/.GET.200.json
api/foo/?bar=[bar].GET.200.json
api/foo/(my comment).GET.200.json
```

## Documenting Contracts (.md)
This is handy for documenting request payload parameters. The dashboard will
print the markdown document (as plain text) above the actual payload content.

Create a markdown file following the same filename convention.
The status code can be any number. For example,
```text
api/foo/[user-id].POST.201.md
api/foo/[user-id].POST.201.json
```

## Transforms (.mjs)
Using the same filename convention, files ending
with `.mjs` will process the mock before serving it.

For example, this handler will capitalize the mock body and increment a counter.
```js
export default function capitalizeAllText(mockAsText, requestBody, config) {
  config.database.myCount ??= 0
  config.database.myCount++
  return mockAsText.toUpperCase()
}
```

## API

### `/mockaton/edit` Select a mock for a route
```
PATCH /mockaton/edit
{ 
  "file": "api/foo.200.GET.json"
  "delayed": true // optional
}
```
---
