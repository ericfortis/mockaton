# TODO

- Refactor tests
- Group By Route/Method localstorage
- openapi
  - parsing it for examples?
  - displaying documentation (.openapi)
    - perhaps instead using .js functions `export const doc`
- Preserve focus when refreshing dashboard `init()`
- More real-time updates. Currently, it's only for add/remove mock but not for
  static files and changes from another client (Browser, or Commander). 
- static plugins (content disposition, compression)
